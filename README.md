# Text Utils 
## A Simple Text Manipulation and Background Color Changing Website

Text Utils is a basic website built using React and Tailwind CSS. Its main features include text transformation options like converting text to uppercase, lowercase, and camelCase. Additionally, it provides a text-to-speech feature for reading entered text, which can be paused and resumed. Users can also change the website's background color in real-time using RGB values.
